## What is Notepads and why do I care?

I have been waiting long enough for a modern Windows 10 notepad app to come so I decide to create one myself. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Notepad++, VS Code, and Sublime are great text editors. I have used them and I will continue to use them in the future. However, they are either too heavy or less interactive. I had a desire to replace a win32 notepad.exe with a software that was lightweight and looked impressive to get things done as quickly as possible (for example, as a turnaround text editor to quickly modify config files or write some notes). Most importantly, it had to be blazingly fast and appeal to everyone. 

So here comes the ‚ÄúNotepads‚Äù üéâ (s stands for Sets).

* Fluent design with a built-in tab system.
* Blazingly fast and lightweight.
* Launch from the command line or PowerShell by typing: `notepads` or `notepads %FilePath%`.
* Multi-line handwriting support.
* Built-in Markdown live preview.
* Built-in diff viewer (preview your changes).
* Session snapshot and multi-instances.

## Platform limitations (UWP):

* You cannot associate potentially harmful file types (.ps1, .bat, .xaml, etc.) with Notepads.
* If you drag a file into Notepads, file save picker will ask you to save it before closing due to UWP restriction.
* Notepads does not work well with large files; the file size limit is set to 1MB for now. I will add large file support later.

## Disclaimer and Privacy statement:

To be 100% transparent:

* Notepads does not and will never collect user information in terms of user privacy.
* I will not track your IP.

I am using analytics service "AppCenter" to collect basic usage data plus some minimum telemetry to help me debug runtime errors. Here is the thread I made clear on this topic: https://github.com/JasonStein/Notepads/issues/334 

Feel free to review the source code or build your own version of Notepads since it is 100% open sourced.

You might notice that I work for Microsoft but Notepads is my personal project that I accomplish during free time (to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve moreüòÉ). I do not work for the Windows team, nor do I work for a Microsoft UX/App team. I am not expert on creating Windows apps either. I learned how to code UWP as soon as I started this project, so don‚Äôt put too much hope on me or treat it as a project sponsored by Microsoft.
