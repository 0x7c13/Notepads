*[0x7c13](https://github.com/0x7c13)* with the help of the Github Notepads App community built the *[Notepads](https://github.com/0x7c13/Notepads)* app as a free app. This APP is provided by *[0x7c13](https://github.com/0x7c13)* at no cost and is intended for use as is.

We will not use or share your information or usage data with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  

### Information Collection and Use  
For a better experience while using this app, certain usage data and errors are collected for identifying issues or improving the user experience of the app. *[Visual Studio AppCenter](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/)* analytics service is used in this app to collect basic usage data plus some minimum telemetry to help debug runtime errors. See thread [#334](https://github.com/0x7c13/Notepads/issues/334) for more details.
The app does NOT use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Note: Visual Studio App Center is scheduled for retirement on March 31, 2025. Notepads v1.5.6.0+ starts to use Microsoft Store Services SDK to log non-privacy usage data and errors.
