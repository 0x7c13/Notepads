# Notepads CI/CD documentation

* after merging the PR, the first run of the main workflow will not complete successfully, because it requires specific setup explained in this documentation

## *. Run workflow manually

Once you've set up all the steps above correctly, you should be able to successfully complete a manual execution of the main workflow "Notepads CI/CD Pipeline".

  1. Go to GitHub project -> "Actions" tab

  2. From the "Workflows" list on the left, click on "Notepads CI/CD Pipeline"

  3. On the right, next to the "This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger" label, click on the "Run workflow" dropdown, make sure the default branch is selected (if not manually changed, should be main or master) in the "Use workflow from" dropdown and click the "Run workflow" button

## *. Set up Dependabot

Dependabot is a GitHub native security tool that goes through the dependencies in your project and creates alerts, and PRs with updates when a new and/or non-vulnerable version is found.

- for PRs with version updates, this pipeline comes pre-configured for all current dependency sources in your project, so at "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" -> "Dependabot", you should be able to see all tracked sources of dependencies, when they have been checked last and view a full log of the last check

### Set up security alerts and updates
##### - GitHub, through Dependabot, also natively offers a security check for vulnerable dependencies

1. Go to "Settings" tab of your repo

2. Go to "Security&Analysis" section

3. Click "Enable" for both "Dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot security updates"

- By enabling "Dependabot alerts", you would be notified for any vulnerable dependencies in your project. At "Security" tab -> "Dependabot alerts", you can manage all alerts. By clicking on an alert, you would be able to see a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and a viable solution.

- By enabling "Dependabot security updates", you authorize Dependabot to create PRs specifically for **security updates**

### Set up Dependency graph
##### - The "Dependency graph" option should be enabled by default for all public repos, but in case it isn't:

1. Go to "Settings" tab of your repo

2. Go to "Security&Analysis" section

3. Click "Enable" for the "Dependency graph" option

- this option enables the "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" section -> "Dependencies" tab, in which all the dependencies for the project are listed, under the different manifests they are included in

## *. CodeQL

CodeQL is GitHub's own industry-leading semantic code analysis engine. CodeQL requires no setup, because it comes fully pre-configured by us. 

To activate it and see its results, only a push commit or a merge of a PR to the default branch of your repository, is required. 

We've also configured CodeQL to run on schedule, so every day at 8:00AM UTC, it automatically test the code.

- you can see the results here at **Security** tab -> **Code scanning alerts** -> **CodeQL**:

![CodeQL_results](/ScreenShots/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/CodeQL_results.png)

- on the page of each result, you can see an explanation of what the problem is and also one or more solutions:
